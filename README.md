## Features
`MongoDB Setup` – Installed, configured, and tested a MongoDB environment.  

`Database Schema` – Designed a NoSQL schema using the Document Object Model (DOM) technique.   

`Collections` – Three main collections:  
 - Members – Stores player and coach details, including performance stats.
 - Teams – Contains team details, including jersey colors and tournament stats.
 - Matches – Records game results, player scores, and referee details.  

`CRUD Operations` – Implemented Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities.  

`Aggregation Pipelines` – Used MongoDB aggregation functions to derive insights (e.g., top scorers, team standings).   

`Cloud Deployment` - Hosted the database on MongoDB Atlas for remote access.
